# Usage:

You can simply run the program and it will ask you for the address, port and password.

Alternatively you can use launch parameters such as:

-a or -address servers.mydomain.com
You can enter an IP address instead of a domain name ofcourse.

-p or -port 12345
There is NO default port!!!

-pw or -password MyPassword
You can use quatation marks if you're paranoid!
